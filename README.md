# Welcome! To the sample Any Weather app

This create-react-app application has a base you can springboard off of for the challenge

## Running
To run locally, do `npm i` followed by `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Weather API
The weather API docs can be found here [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api) and a basic implementation function has been provided in the APITools.js file.
As to not overwhelm the free API, some sample data has been provided in the weatherData.json for testing purposes.
I have an account with API keys for each team which I'll distribute those once we get started

Good luck and enjoy!
